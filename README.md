## Information

<details><summary><h3>How to use</h3></summary>

There are 3 good methods to using these scripts:
1. Importing one of the Bookmarklets.html files using [these instructions](https://github.com/005Konz/Blooket-Cheats/blob/main/tutorial/readme.md)
<!-- 2. Going to the [GitHub pages site](https://005konz.github.io/Blooket-Cheats), choosing a gamemode, then dragging a cheat to your bookmarks bar or clicking one to copy the script -->
2. Copying a script and running it in the inspect element console

<details><summary><h3>What can I do if JavaScript is blocked?</h3></summary>

We don't actually know what to do about this or how to fix it, sorry.
</details>

<details><summary><h3>(script) is not working?</h3></summary>

Make sure you're running it properly, if it still doesn't work and other cheats do, then [make an issue](https://github.com/005Konz/Blooket-Cheats/issues)
</details>

<details><summary><h3>Which script should I use to make a bookmarklet?</h3></summary>

You should use the scripts ending in ".min.js", as using the others will have errors due to formatting.
</details>

<details><summary><h3>Can you give me infinite tokens / bypass daily limit / permanently give me blooks / change pack luck?</h3></summary>

No, these are things we would've already done if they were possible, they're managed on the backend of Blooket so we can't modify them
</details>

<details><summary><h3>Can you make hacks for (game)</h3></summary>

No
</details>

<details><summary><h3>Can you make more Battle Royale cheats</h3></summary>

Battle Royale is a gamemode that works almost entirely on the host's end. The only thing we have control over is answering questions.
</details>

<details><summary><h3>What's the Mobile GUI?</h3></summary>

The mobile GUI is the first GUI Minesraft2 ever made. Some people said it worked on mobile and it's a lot neater for mobile use apparently so we just called it that.
